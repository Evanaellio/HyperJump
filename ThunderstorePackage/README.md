# Hyper Jump
Jump higher and leap further.

To install the mod, copy the Mods folder inside the zip into your Boneworks directory.

Hyper jumps and leaps are best used in exterior environments (unless you like fracturing your skull on the ceiling or smashing your face against a wall).

Use Bonemenu to configure the strength of the hyper jumps and leaps, or disable them altogether.
