# Hyper Jump

Jump higher and leap further.

To install the mod, copy the Mods folder inside the zip into your Boneworks directory.

Hyper jumps and leaps are best used in exterior environments (unless you like fracturing your skull on the ceiling or
smashing your face against a wall).

Hyper leaps only apply when walking/running, and will propel you towards where you are looking.

Hyper jumps/leaps can be charged so that the jump power scales with how long the jump button was pressed for. If disabled, all jumps will be performed at max power.

Use Bonemenu to configure the following :

| Property                     | Description                                                             | Default Value |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Upward Jump Multiplier       | How high the hyper jumps will go                                        | 16            |
| Forward Leap Multiplier      | How far the hyper leaps will go                                         | 3             |
| Enable Jump Charging         | Enables scaling jump power with charge time                             | true          |
| Jump Charging Time (seconds) | How many seconds to hold the jump button until you reach max jump power | 1.5           |
| Enable Hyper Jump            | Enables or disables the hyper jumps/leaps entirely                      | true          |
